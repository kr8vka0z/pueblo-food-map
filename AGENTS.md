# Hosting — Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext

- **Live production URL:** https://pueblofoodmap.com/ (primary)
- **Direct Worker URL:** https://pueblo-food-map.kyle-boyd.workers.dev/ (fallback / bypass CDN)
- **HTTP/www redirect:** HTTP requests and `www.pueblofoodmap.com` both 301-redirect to `https://pueblofoodmap.com` via Cloudflare zone redirect rule + Always-Use-HTTPS.
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Workers, project name `pueblo-food-map` (configured in `wrangler.jsonc`)
- **Adapter:** `@opennextjs/cloudflare` — translates Next.js App Router output into Worker format
- **CI/CD:** Cloudflare Workers Builds, connected to this GitHub repo via the CF dashboard. There is NO GitHub Actions YAML for deploys — wiring is entirely in the CF dashboard.
  - Push to `main` → production deploy (automatic)
  - Open a PR → unique preview deploy URL (posted as a check on the PR, visible in the CF dashboard under that build)
  - **Build command:** `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`
  - **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy` (CF default)

## Build and preview locally

```bash
npm run preview   # OpenNext build + local Worker emulator at http://127.0.0.1:8788
npm run deploy    # OpenNext build + wrangler deploy to production
                  # Requires `wrangler login` first; rarely needed — CI handles deploys
```

## Operational notes

- **Build logs:** Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `pueblo-food-map` → Deployments tab
- **Rollback:** Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `pueblo-food-map` → Deployments tab → find a previous successful deployment → "Rollback to this deployment". Production traffic switches in ~30 seconds.
- **Environment variables:** Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `pueblo-food-map` → Settings → Variables and Secrets. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are baked into the client bundle at build time (same model as Vercel). Set them in both the "Production" and "Preview" environments.
